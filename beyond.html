									<h1>Defining Aftercare for Heartfailure Patients</h1>
                            
									<h2>About the project</h2>
                                    <p><a href="https://bynd.com/" target="_blank">Beyond</a>, a design agency, sought persona research, UX strategy, and MVP ideation for a pharmaceutical client (confidential under NDA). In launching a therapy drug for patients of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), the client wanted a mobile app supporting the drug's 12-week aftercare program. At first, the desired user was communicated to us as CHF patients. We later more appropriately identified caregivers as primary users, as they had the most active role in aftercare.</p>

                                                <p> The project was put on hold before design began, as the FDA rejected the drug in May 2014 and requested additional clinical trials. Unfortunately the app was never developed, as clinical trials did not pass.</p>

									<h2>Approach</h2>
                                    <p>In order to truly understand Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) and the nuances behind the lives of patients living with it, we needed to identify the key moments that matter for patients. What are the real causes that drive them to hospital? What are their experiences + interactions in the hospital? How is the post discharge experience (follow ups, treatment plans, lifestyle changes)? We relied heavily on qualitative research methods to help us get answers, and to define this patient journey map.</p>
                                    
                                    <span class="image fit"><img src="imagesbeyond/bd_journey.png"></span>
                                    
                                    <h3>Key Insights</h3>
             						<p>In speaking with patients recently diagnosed with CHF, we realized that the caregivers played a huge role in managing the aftercare&mdash;at times, moreso than than the patients themselves. We focused on these behavioral discoveries when defining our target audience:</p>	
                                    	<li>Lack of patient adherence to instructions after diagnosis is common.</li>
                                        <li>The shared goal between patient + caregiver (despite mostly contrasting goals) is that each wants to attain or support a "new normal" in their life after diagnosis.</li>
                                    	<li>Primary caregivers are managing a network of secondary caregivers (mostly family members), which requires intensive scheduling + coordination.</li>	
                                    	<li>Communication within this caregiver team is not streamlined and often a cause of stress for both patients + caregivers.</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Considering these insights, we found the caregiver to be our most reliable target user to ultimately help patients achieve their goal of a "new normal."
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <hr class="major" />	
                                    
                                    <h2>Personas</h2>
                                    <p>In order to develop key user personas as a group, we conducted an affinity mapping exercise to map out caregivers' and patients' mindsets based on our understanding of the research. We ultimately narrowed down 4 personas (2 patients; 2 caregivers) based on their stages of experience with CHF. We also used patient pain points expressed in the research to inform caregiver (CG) needs.</p>

                                    <h2>User Goals</h2>       
                                    <p>Upon developing our personas, we were able to refine our problem space and develop 3 key groups of user goals that align with our persona needs.</p>
                                    	<li><strong>Track + Monitor Patient Health:</strong> Both CGs and patients can record 3 key health status metrics: weight, sodium intake, and medications taken. Goals for each metric may be set for the patient, as well as alerts for metrics that fall within a danger zone. Goals and alerts will inform what type of actions are recommended to CGs within the "Actionable Dashboard" and "Caregiver Tasklist" features. A weekly view is available to help CGs get a larger picture of progress. General health notes may also be input here.</li>
                                    	<br>
                                        <li><strong>Collaborate on Tasks:</strong> For CG teams of 2 or more, this collaborative tasklist will allow for easier assignment and collaboration of tasks. Calendar syncing will allow for quick-add tasks for events like doctor's appointments. This feature will listen for alerts in the "Health Status Tracker" feature, and recommend tasks based on stats in the danger zone.</li>
                                    	<br>
                                        <li><strong>Get Alerts:</strong> Both CGs and patients will receive APN notifications, leading to an actionable list of tasks/followups on their homepage dashboard. These APNs include urgent patient health alerts, to-do assignment notifications, and late to-do reminders. There will be separate dashboard views for CGs and patients.</li>

                                    <p>The map below represents the structural organization of the mobile app based on an MVP feature list we ideated around tracking patient health, collaborating with a caregiver team, and reviewing overall health status.</p>

                                    <h2>Feature Thinking</h2>
                                    <p><strong>Per the client's NDA, I'm restricted from sharing any user flows and wireframes.</strong> Therefore, instead of visuals, I've documented my thought process around the MVP's features.</p>
                            		
                                    <h3>Track Patient Health</h3>
                                    <p>Patients are prompted to record 3 key daily health vitals: <strong>weight, sodium, and medications taken.</strong> Vitals will automatically sync if the patient has wearables/hardware. In addition to these objective metrics, patients will be asked a subjective question of "How are you feeling?" in the morning and evening, with emoji selections ranging from sad, neutral, to happy. As depression is common amongst CHF patients, communication of mood can help CGs be on alert from the start of the day to watch for certain symptoms outside of numeric stats.</p>
                                    <h3>Monitor Progress</h3>
                                    <p>CGs can view health metrics over time to get a sense of progress from a weekly or monthly perspective. Each of the 3 vitals are visually represented in detail in the Progress feature, with daily details, timestamps, notes, and photos (if any). PDF reports of progress can also be exported for doctor's visits.</p>
                                    <h3>Collaborate on Tasks</h3>
                                    <p>CGs can set tasks and collaborate with their CG team on their patient's health and daily goals. The CG team's list of tasks and deadlines live on the homepage/dashboard. CGs may assign tasks to both the patient or a specific CGs, and set deadlines and reminders. When creating (or editing) a task, a CG may select from a list of common suggestions to help them get started (especially considering CGs expressed a need for guidance and professional recommendation).</p>

                                    <h2>Development Strategy</h2>
                                    <p>We had proposed key considerations to the client for whether we would go with a native, hybrid, or web-only approach in development.</p>
                                    <div class="row">
										<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
											<h3>Native Advantages</h3>
                                            <li>Realtime hardware integration (Bluetooth tracking device)</li>
                                            <li>More device features available than a Web App has access to</li>

										</div>
										<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
											<h3>Hybrid Web Advantages</h3>
                                            <li>Code reuse across platforms, different device sizes/types</li>
                                            <li>Maintenance easier, quicker to deploy new versions</li>
                                            <li>Easier to find web developers who understand the app</li>

                                    <p>The client ultimately went with our recommendation to go native, despite longer development process. This choice was more future-thinking, as it supported a more efficient patient experience with the possibility of hardware/wearble integration.</p>

                                    <p>The project was put on hold before design began, as the FDA rejected the drug in May 2014 and requested additional clinical trials. Unfortunately the app was never developed, as clinical trials did not pass. The client is currently in the middle of clinical trials for a revamped version of the original drug, and plans to continue this project upon FDA approval.</p>
