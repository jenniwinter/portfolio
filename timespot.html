									<h2>About the project</h2>
                                    <p>TimeSpot is a social platform that aggregates content from various news and social media sites, allowing users to spot connections between the timelines of friends, celebrities, and major historical events in a single view. The client needed UX consultation on a user interface, user flows, and redesign concepts for an alpha.</p>

									<h2>Approach</h2>
                                    <p>What's a timeline app without content? Not much! A way to pull real content was the first step to getting this project off the ground. Our clients (two software engineers) were well underway in developing a content-mining engine that could pull adequate and accurately timestamped content in time for the UX design definition.</p>
                                    <p>The first step we wanted users to take was to connect their social accounts. Social connectivity would allow the experience to feel personal and fresh with the latest updates from the users' circle. Based on these factors, we defined the key goals for TimeSpot's users.</p>
                                    <h3>Key User Goals</h3>
             							<li><strong>Connect</strong> social media feeds to populate timelines.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Compare</strong> multiple timelines</li>
                                        <li><strong>Interact</strong> with timeline content</li>
                                        <li><strong>Manage</strong> people (a.k.a. friends) and groups.</li>
                                    
                                    <hr class="break" />	
                                    
                                    <h2>Design</h2>
                                    <p>The design goals were to provide a timeline layout that:
                                        <li>can be navigated easily despite a large timeline window (years).</li>
                                        <li>has visually distinguishable content from multiple timelines (up to 3).</li>
                                        <li>displays information in an easily legible way.</li>
                                    </p>
                                    <br>    
                                    
                                    <p>We sketched + researched a variety of ways to view multiple timelines worth of content on a single page. The visual archetypes in which time is presented include the horizontal + vertical lines scored with specific points in time. Vertical is commonly used in digital spaces due to users’ familiarity with up/down scroll. Still, both share the same problem: cramming large amounts of content into the limits of one screen. We played with a circlular concept based on tree rings, where an entire life of events can be contained within a circle of rings. However, this proved difficult to navigate.</p>
                                    <p>We ultimately decided on a combination of both horizontal and vertical views.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>Horizontal view</h3>
                                    <p>I used the horizontal view to display a zoomed-out representation of activity (not content) across multiple timelines. Users need to eye-track the full timeline horizontally to choose the smaller window of time to view. With a simple click into an active area with the positioning brackets, users can jump through time without the need to scroll far.</p>

                                    <h3>Vertical view</h3>       
                                    <p>I used the vertical view to display the content for the zoomed-in window of time. Users would need to scroll vertically if there's a lot of content within that window. The colored representations from the horizontal view carries over in this vertical view, making the content easily distinguishable. Any newly selected comparisons from the dropdowns will be reflected as a new color in this horizontal view. </p>

                                    <h3>Create and interact</h3>       
                                    <p>We designed only the very basic features to support the alpha, for which the goal was to test the experience of interacting with a populated timeline. The features included allowing users to simply add to and interact with timelines. After selecting the timelines to compare, users could add new content to their timeline through the "Create a spot" feature; view profiles of all timelines being compared; and socially interact with timeline content.</p>

                                    <h2>Alpha Testing + Post Mortem</h2>
                                    <p>With the very basics of the alpha defined, the testing goal was to define a fuller feature offering based on feedback on the timeline layout. The alpha was completed in late 2014, and private testing began shortly thereafter. However, Timespot has since pivoted from this concept we designed to what is now a social planning mobile app. Although this alpha we designed never moved into its next phase of feature planning, this was an interesting case study on how to prioritize for an alpha version to test concepts first before designing for a full product.</p>
